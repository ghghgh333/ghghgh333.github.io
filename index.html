                    For Four, baking isn't just a process; it's a conversation between the hands and the dough. Raised in a family that cherished the simple joy of a shared meal, he discovered his passion early on, mesmerized by the magic of turning flour, water, and salt into something warm and life-giving.

                <p class="baker-bio">
                    After honing his skills in classic European bakeries, Four founded Fofo Bakery with a clear vision: to create bread that is both honest and elegant. He believes in using the highest quality ingredients, patient fermentation, and a deep respect for tradition, while always exploring modern techniques to create the perfect loaf.
